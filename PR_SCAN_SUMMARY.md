# CI Local Replica Scan — Summary

This is a concise, human-friendly summary of the local CI replica scan run.

Top counts
- Errors: 0 (syntax error in examples/unused_imports.py was fixed in the head copy)
- Warnings: several (unused imports, missing trailing newlines)
- Info: formatting suggestions (tabs, import ordering)

High-priority items to fix (in order):
1. Python syntax errors in example/test files (fixed)
2. Real errors and high-severity rule violations (none in this run)
3. Warnings: unused imports across the repo (app.py, rules.py, tests)
4. Formatting: Tabs in `pyproject.toml` and `src/rhaid/register_rules.py`, missing trailing newlines

What I changed for verification
- Fixed `examples/unused_imports.py` to remove the syntax error.
- Saved full JSON scan results to `ci_head_scan_report.json`.

Next recommended actions (prioritized)
- Remove or justify unused imports (warnings).
- Normalize import blocks (auto-sort or use isort).
- Replace tabs with spaces in the files flagged by `format:tabs`.
- Add missing trailing newlines and fix minor formatting.
- Optionally: update baseline to accept known/intentional warnings if desired.

If you want I can (A) update baseline automatically, (B) auto-fix simple warnings (trailing newline/tabs), (C) open a PR with fixes for top warnings, (D) stop here. Prioritize A-C — I can start with the highest-priority fix automatically.
